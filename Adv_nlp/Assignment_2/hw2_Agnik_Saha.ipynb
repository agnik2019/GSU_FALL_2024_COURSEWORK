    "### Impact of Rare Terms in Co-occurrence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Including rare terms in co-occurrence analysis can affect results in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noise**: Rare terms appear infrequently, adding noise and making it hard to identify true co-occurrences.\n",
    "- **Skewed Metrics**: Metrics like PMI or Chi-squared tests can inflate the significance of rare terms, leading to misleading results.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Models may overfit to rare terms, reducing generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency Thresholding**: Set a minimum frequency to filter out rare terms, reducing noise.\n",
    "- **Smoothing**: Use smoothing (e.g., Laplace) to handle low co-occurrence counts, preventing inflated significance.\n",
    "- **Weighting (TF-IDF)**: Apply TF-IDF to downplay rare terms and prevent them from skewing co-occurrence metrics.\n",
    "- **Randomization Tests**: Shuffle terms/documents to identify statistically significant co-occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Misleading Values\n",
    "\n",
    "False significance can lead to faulty clusters, misclassifications, and incorrect graphs, reducing model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Solutions Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thresholding** uses sufficient data, improving reliability.\n",
    "- **Smoothing** adjusts small probabilities, reducing noise.\n",
    "- **TF-IDF** reduces the influence of rare terms.\n",
    "- **Randomization** lowers the risk of overfitting or false positives.\n"
